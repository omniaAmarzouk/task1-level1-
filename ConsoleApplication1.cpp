/*  Homework 2: Create your own Logic!
● Write a program that reads in integers for 3 classroom-related variables:
○ Number of boys (nb), number of girls (ng), number of teachers (nt)
● Prepare and print a boolean variable for these cases:
● nb greater than 25
● ng less than or equal to 30
● nb > 20 and nt > 2, or ng > 30 and nt > 4
● Either nb < 60 or ng < 70
● Neither nb >= 60 nor ng >= 70
● nb is 10 more than ng
● The difference between nb and ng is more than 10 or nt > 5
● Either nb is 10 more than ng, or ng is 15 more than nb*/
